    The monkey is a powerful species both physically and intellectually. It has powerful limbs and a long tail, allowing
    it to jump long distances from one tree branch to another. The tail is strong enough to keep a firm grasp on the
    branch, allowing the animal to swing on it. A monkey is known for its playful nature. However, it is frequently
    known as a mischievous animal. One often hears stories about monkeys snatching fruits or vegetables or other things
    from people walking on the street or from their homes.
    Monkeys are apes who live in trees. For these wild creatures, the forest is the ideal environment. Plants, fruits,
    nuts, and other veggies are their primary food source, and a few species of monkeys also eat meat or insects.
    Monkeys are found in many forms in various places of the world. Baboons, Chimpanzees, Orangutangs, and Gorillas are
    some of the most common monkey species. Monkeys have a more advanced communicating system that is similar to that of
    humans. Individual gestures are used to express all emotions, including happiness, grief, and rage. Hence, this
    animal is a great companion to humans.
