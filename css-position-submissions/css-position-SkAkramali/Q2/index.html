      <p class="monkey__story" >Once upon a time, there was a clever monkey. He lived on a
beautiful island, in an apple tree. One day, a crocodile swam
to the island. ‘I’m hungry,’ he said.
So the monkey threw a red apple to the crocodile. The
crocodile munched and munched. The next day, the
crocodile came back. ‘Please, may I have two apples?’ he asked. He ate one and gave
one to his wife. 
The crocodile went to see the monkey every day, to listen to his tales and eat his
apples. He wanted to be clever, just like the monkey. The crocodile’s wife had an idea.
‘Why don’t you eat his heart? Then you’ll be clever, just like him!’
The next day, he said to the monkey, ‘Come to my house! We’ll have lunch together, to
thank you for the apples.’
But when he arrived, the crocodile snapped and said, ‘Monkey! I want to eat your heart,
so I can be as clever as you!’
The clever monkey thought quickly and said, ‘But... I haven’t got my heart here. It’s on
the island, in the apple tree.’
They all went back to the island. ‘Wait here, and I will get my heart,’ said the monkey.
The monkey quickly climbed the tree and sat at the top. ‘Oh, Crocodile. You are
greedy. Of course you can’t have my heart. And now, you can’t have my apples!’ And
the clever monkey laughed and laughed! After some time, the monkey, listening to all the 
animals, jumped to the ground. He said, “What are you guys talking about? There is no need to
 be afraid of the lion! The lion is just a dumb animal. I go for rides on his back when I want to!” 
 All the animals started laughing. The elephant said, “Hey, monkey, have you gone crazy? The lion 
 might not have bullied you, but to give you a ride on his back! We are not fools here.”
The monkey said, “Ok! I will prove it to you all. I am going to the other part of the jungle where the 
big banyan tree is located. If the lion comes here, send him to me. I will come back here, riding on his back!</p>
