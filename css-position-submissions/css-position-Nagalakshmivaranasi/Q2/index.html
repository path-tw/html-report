      Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the
      infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians
      are counted as monkeys except the apes. Thus monkeys, in that sense, constitute an incomplete paraphyletic
      grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms
      monkeys and simians synonyms in regard to their scope.
      In 1812, Étienne Geoffroy grouped the apes and the Cercopithecidae group of monkeys together and established the
      name Catarrhini, "Old World monkeys", ("singes de l'Ancien Monde" in French).[3][4][5] The extant sister of the
      Catarrhini in the monkey ("singes") group is the Platyrrhini (New World monkeys).[3] Some nine million years
      before the divergence between the Cercopithecidae and the apes,[6] the Platyrrhini emerged within "monkeys" by
      migration to South America from Afro-Arabia (the Old World),[citation needed][7][8] likely by ocean.[9][10][better
      source needed] Apes are thus deep in the tree of extant and extinct monkeys, and any of the apes is distinctly
      closer related to the Cercopithecidae than the Platyrrhini are.
      Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground,
      such as baboons. Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be
      intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys.Within suborder Haplorhini, the simians are a sister group to the
      tarsiers – the two members diverged some 70 million years ago.[11] New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys
      emerged within the simians roughly 35 million years ago. Old World monkeys and apes emerged within the catarrhine
      monkeys about 25 million years ago. Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus (35–32 million
      years ago) are also considered monkeys by primatologists.[12][9][13][14][15][16]
      Lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys, but strepsirrhine primates (suborder Strepsirrhini). The simians'
      sister group, the tarsiers, are also haplorhine primates; however, they are also not monkeys.[citation needed]Apes
      emerged within monkeys as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini, so cladistically they are monkeys as
      well. However, there has been resistance to directly designate apes (and thus humans) as monkeys, so "Old World
      monkey" may be taken to mean either the Cercopithecoidea (not including apes) or the Catarrhini (including
      apes).[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25] That apes are monkeys was already realized by Georges-Louis Leclerc,
      Comte de Buffon in the 18th century.[26] Linnaeus placed this group in 1758 together with the tarsiers, in a
      single genus "Simia" (sans Homo), an ensemble now recognised as the Haplorhini.[27]
      Monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished from other primates by having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous
      penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers.[28][better source needed]Historical and modern terminologyThe Barbary
      macaque is also known as the Barbary ape.According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word "monkey" may
      originate in a German version of the Reynard the Fox fable, published c. 1580. In this version of the fable, a
      character named Moneke is the son of Martin the Ape.[29] In English, no clear distinction was originally made
      between "ape" and "monkey"; thus the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica entry for "ape" notes that it is either a
      synonym for "monkey" or is used to mean a tailless humanlike primate.[30] Colloquially, the terms "monkey" and
      "ape" are widely used interchangeably.[31][32] Also, a few monkey species have the word "ape" in their common
      name, such as the Barbary ape.
      Later in the first half of the 20th century, the idea developed that there were trends in primate evolution and
      that the living members of the order could be arranged in a series, leading through "monkeys" and "apes" to
      humans.[33] Monkeys thus constituted a "grade" on the path to humans and were distinguished from "apes".Scientific
      classifications are now more often based on monophyletic groups, that is groups consisting of all the descendants
      of a common ancestor. The New World monkeys and the Old World monkeys are each monophyletic groups, but their
      combination was not, since it excluded hominoids (apes and humans). Thus, the term "monkey" no longer referred to
      a recognized scientific taxon. The smallest accepted taxon which contains all the monkeys is the infraorder
      Simiiformes, or simians. However this also contains the hominoids, so that monkeys are, in terms of currently
      recognized taxa, non-hominoid simians.
      Several science-fiction and fantasy stories have depicted non-human (fantastical or alien) antagonistic characters
      refer to humans as monkeys, usually in a derogatory manner, as a form of metacommentary.[39]A group of monkeys may
      be commonly referred to as a tribe or a troop.[40]Two separate groups of primates are referred to as "monkeys":
      New World monkeys (platyrrhines) from South and Central America and Old World monkeys (catarrhines in the
      superfamily Cercopithecoidea) from Africa and Asia. Apes (hominoids)—consisting of gibbons, orangutans, gorillas,
      chimpanzees and bonobos, and humans—are also catarrhines but were classically distinguished from
      monkeys.[41][9][42][43] Tailless monkeys may be called "apes", incorrectly according to modern usage; thus the
      tailless Barbary macaque is historically called the "Barbary ape".[32]Description
