            <ol type="I">
                <li>PREAMBLE</li>
                <p>The Department of Technical Education is conducting admissions into various diploma level Engineering and Non-Engineering Courses who passed SSC or its Equivalent and qualified in APPOLYCET. Since there is a great demand for skilled supervisors in various industries, Government has decided to increase the seats by establishing new polytechnics and conducting admissions in second shift diploma courses in polytechnics and private engineering colleges.</p>
                <li>RATIONALE FOR WEB COUNSELING</li>
                <p>The process of inviting the qualified candidates of POLYCET and allotting seats as per their option is known as Counseling. In the past, candidate used to attend in any one of the 8 Counseling Centres for securing a seat in a polytechnic. In this process candidates have to travel all the way to report at any one of the counseling centres more than once and it is also a time consuming process and expensive.</p>
                <li>WHAT IS WEB COUNSELING</li>
                <p>For the Convenience of the Candidates from the academic year 2009-10, Government has decided to adopt a total web based counseling procedure where a candidate can exercise options i.e. candidate can select a polytechnic and course which he/she intends to study, through internet centre or internet facility available at his/her residence and where access to such facility is not available, from any one of the help line centers established by Govt in the districts. Such help line centers are availble atleast one in each district.</p>
